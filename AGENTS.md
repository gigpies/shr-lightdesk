# SHR Lightdesk working agreements

Read README.md, docs/STATUS.md, docs/BLUEPRINT.md and the relevant owning document.
Follow ../AGENTS.md for GigPies peer coordination. Inspect hostname and live Git
state. Preserve interactive sessions and unrelated edits. Existing siblings are
read-only unless separately authorized. GigPies owns final integration; SHR Desk
owns audio UI; Lightdesk owns lighting UI; SHR Lux owns lighting algorithms,
fixture evaluation, cue/effect execution, arbitration and physical output.

Rust 1.97.1, edition 2024, Cargo.lock in source control, no sibling path dependencies.
Use CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 and normal target/. Review disk space before major builds;
20 GiB free and 5 GiB output are review thresholds, not permission for blanket cleanup.
Keep source, user data and useful evidence. Remove only this task's disposable output.

Distinguish planned, implemented, offline-validated and hardware-verified. The
simulator is disposable acceptance scaffolding, never a production Lux substitute.
No automatic audio/MIDI/DMX/socket/service/display/host-font operations. Physical
output and shared load acceptance require explicit session scope. Never infer
physical light from a preview, descriptor, ACK or successful packet submission.

Fast state, control contract, recovery, controller and rendering tests stay default.
Run focused tests while implementing and the complete normal suite for shared
models/rendering/routing/safety. Long research/exhaustive/hardware tests are opt-in.
Report run and intentionally skipped classes. Keep artifacts/ and user/ ignored.
Preserve superseded owning plans in docs/archive/ and update current status.

No publication or deployment is implied. Before any future commit, inspect live
status and only named staged content; preserve unrelated edits. Fonts retain OFL
and the MIT rendering adaptation retains attribution. See docs/DEVELOPMENT.md.

## GigPies task tracking

Use `docs/GIGPIES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for GigPies work owned here. Keep each task plan,
implementation state, acceptance checklist, evidence and next action in the same
card; update it with the change. Shared integration tasks have one card in
GigPies, linked from contributor plans. STATUS, maps, handoffs and knowledge notes
route to task owners or preserve dated evidence; never mirror current task state.
Archive closed cards once; keep the active queue limited to open work. Reference
projects do not become GigPies runtime modules merely because code is reused.

## Reader-facing documentation

Keep README short and visual. Route musicians through the operating guide;
assume musical knowledge. Put protocols, implementation detail, validation and
work logs in engineering references or archives. Update the existing owning
guide instead of appending feature histories to the README.
