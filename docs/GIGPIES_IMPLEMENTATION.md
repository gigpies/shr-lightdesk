# SHR Lightdesk: plan and implementation

Lightdesk owns lighting interaction and presentation. Lux owns fixture evaluation,
authority, timing, analysis and output. The surface must not implement another engine.

## Delivered contract and evidence

The real private Lux client, native software frontend, reviewed commands, timed
release/recovery presentation and named-analysis provenance have software evidence
in [STATUS](STATUS.md). [Capabilities](CAPABILITIES.md) describes supported behavior.
Physical output remains unknown; display/controller/LED operation is unqualified.

The shared [GP-MUSIC card](../../gigpies/docs/archive/records/2026-10-11-gp-music.md) owns harmonic/progression and tentative verse/chorus integration. Lightdesk contributes strict consumer validation and read-only presentation; Lux owns the analysis.

The archived shared [GP-SCENES card](../../gigpies/docs/archive/records/2026-10-11-gp-scenes.md) owns the scene map/director integration. Lightdesk owns strict versioned consumption, map editing and owner-preview presentation; Lux owns selection, transitions and resolved effects.

## Next work

Physical console operation is a contribution to shared GP-H2; keep its plan/progress
in GigPies. Fixture-output presentation depends on Lux LX-06 and must distinguish
submission from observed output. Richer patch/cue/effect UI must follow an accepted
Lux capability, never a mock feature. Add one module-only task card here when that
provider increment is selected; no READY/WAITING copy of completed LD-01..04.

## Tracking and verification

This is the owning plan for module-only GigPies work. Keep each new task's plan,
implementation state, checklist, evidence and next action together here. Shared
integration tasks live only in the [GigPies integration plan](https://github.com/gigpies/gigpies/blob/main/docs/development/MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md);
link to their cards instead of copying status. Follow its task lifecycle and this
repository's AGENTS.md. STATUS/acceptance files hold dated evidence, not another queue.
Preserve closed milestone details in the linked archive; do not reopen old launch cards.
A documentation reconciliation does not rerun tests or qualify hardware.

[Historical plan and milestone evidence](archive/tracking-before-2026-10-09/GIGPIES_IMPLEMENTATION.md). Its launch instructions are retired.

The shared [GP-UI-COMPARE](../../gigpies/docs/archive/records/2026-10-11-gp-ui-compare.md) owns the requested Ratatui/current-renderer comparison.

The shared [GP-PANEL card](../../gigpies/docs/development/MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#gp-panel--shared-physical-instrument-panel) owns the physical Ratatui panel, shared assets and specimen-first migration gates.
