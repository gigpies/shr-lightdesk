# Lighting console screen references

Retained design-reference library, reviewed **2026-10-06**: **16 images**, each individually
inspected and accompanied by a detailed description. Open [the offline gallery](index.html)
to browse pictures and all observations together, or use the per-screen Markdown links below.
The gallery is static HTML with local images; it needs no server, build, scripts or external fonts.

[Audio companion library](https://github.com/gigpies/shr-desk/tree/main/docs/console-screen-reference) · [existing console study](../CONSOLE_STUDY.md) ·
[owning screen plan](../SCREENS.md) · [source register](SOURCES.md) · [manifest](manifest.json)

## How to use this library

1. Find a workflow in the comparison table and open the relevant full-resolution figure.
2. Read its visible-layout/control description before drawing conclusions from colour alone.
3. Use the design implications as hypotheses for original SHR Lightdesk layouts, checked against
   the owning screen plan, runtime capabilities and actual controller/display review.
4. Preserve the difference between observed pixels, source-documented context and our proposals.

The relevant planned areas are Overview, Fixtures, Programmer, Playback, Palettes, Patch/Health and future effect editors. No product code or screen plan
is changed by this collection. The historical study's statement that no screenshots were retained
describes the October 4 review; this separately requested October 6 folder now retains selected figures.

## Workflow comparison

| Design question | Screen IDs | Pattern to consider |
|---|---|---|
| Fixture identity/capabilities | 01, 09, 10 | Fixed IDs and capability-aware attributes; never invent a universal fixture personality. |
| Programmer and empty state | 04, 05, 10, 11 | Selection, active data, unset values, explicit zero and disconnected state are different. |
| Output inspection | 06 | Base/post-master/submitted/physical feedback need separate names and provenance. |
| Colour and discrete choices | 07, 08, 13, 14 | Graphic tools need exact values, capability scope and a complete keyboard route. |
| Effects | 02, 03, 11 | Separate shape, timing and contribution; Lux owns evaluation, phase and physical output. |
| Cues and playback | 12, 15, 16 | Active, selected and next cue are separate; selection/scrolling must never imply GO. |

## Scope and limits

These are complete available source figures, sometimes cropped windows, teaching annotations or
promotional composites. They are not all full-desktop captures. Small original images remain small;
no invented detail or upscaling fills missing text. Versions identify source material, not latest
firmware. No reference console was physically operated. No screenshot proves our own engine,
measurement, device connection, cue timing or output capability. Manufacturer images remain
third-party reference evidence; see [source status](SOURCES.md).

The ONYX images are historical 3.71-named illustrations, and the MagicQ Times and Eos workbook
figures visibly reuse older builds. Individual notes record that provenance. No current-version
appearance, physical colour reproduction or fixture personality is inferred from those images.
